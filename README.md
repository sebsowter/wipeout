# Wipeout in WebGL

Welcome, this is an experimental WebGL project. The intention is to create a raceable track in the style of the PS1 game Wipeout. The code is quite vanilla.

## Tasks

```bash
# install project
npm i

# run project locally
npx vite

# create production build of project
npm vite build
```

## TODO
